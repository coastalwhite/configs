# My configuration files

Here you find my configuration files. This is a bare git repository which should
have the `$HOME` as the work directory.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this configurations is with a gist bash script:

```bash
curl -Lks http://bit.do/coastalwhite_cfgs | /bin/bash
```

## Usage

Feel free to use anything here for your own configuration files. Personalisation
is important though.
